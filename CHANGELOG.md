## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Daily challenge mode** — everyone thinks of the same deterministic character each UTC day
  - `GET /api/v2/daily` returns today's character ID + user completion status (character name/image only revealed after completing)
  - `POST /api/v2/daily` records completion outcome (idempotent; first write wins)
  - Character selected via `dateHash(date) % eligibleCharacters`, stable across all users; cached in KV until UTC midnight
  - `useDailyChallenge` hook — fetches status, exposes `recordCompletion(won, questionsAsked)`
  - Welcome screen card shows play button (if not completed) or result with character name + question count (if completed)
  - `POST /api/v2/game/start` accepts optional `characterId` to pin a specific character into the pool (used by daily challenge)
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Y / N / M / U answer the current question without clicking; ignored when focus is inside an input; desktop-only hint label shown below answer buttons
- **AI win rate stat** — welcome screen footer now shows "AI wins X% of N games" once ≥10 games are recorded

### Changed

- **Soft scoring resilience** — `SCORE_MISMATCH` raised from `0.0` → `0.05`; a single wrong/inconsistent answer no longer permanently zeros out the correct character
- **Fuzzy hard-filter** — `filterPossibleCharacters` now tolerates 1 mismatch (`MAX_MISMATCHES=1`) before eliminating a character, preventing premature elimination from one bad answer
- **Singleton guard** — AI no longer guesses on a singleton candidate until at least 5 questions have been asked (was 0), avoiding false-confident guesses early in the game
- **Zero-candidates fallback** — if all candidates are eliminated (contradictory answers), the engine now forces a guess rather than stalling
- **`detectContradictions` accuracy** — fixed to use the hard-filter count rather than soft probability scores, so contradiction detection is consistent with filtering logic
- Deleted 3 duplicate questions from production DB (`q176` isFromMovie, `q171` isVideoGameCharacter, `q177` isFromBook) that caused double-elimination when the same question appeared twice

### Added

- **User answer reveal on loss** — when the AI fails to guess, `GameOver` now shows a "Who were you thinking of?" input field
- `POST /api/v2/game/reveal` endpoint — accepts the character name + session Q&A answers:
  - Fuzzy-matches the name against `characters` table (exact then LIKE)
  - Backfills `null` attribute values with confidence 0.5 from confident yes/no answers
  - Queues `system:reveal:` correction votes in KV for any contradicting attribute values
  - Stores a `game_reveals` audit row regardless of whether the character was found
- `game_reveals` D1 table — stores `actual_character_name`, `actual_character_id`, `answers` (JSON), `attributes_filled`, `discrepancies`, `created_at`
- Migration `0016_game_reveals.sql` applied to both production and preview databases

## [0.9.0] — 2026-04-18 — Server Engine & Infrastructure

### Added

- **Phase 6: Server-side game engine** — Bayesian engine ported to Workers (`functions/api/v2/_game-engine.ts`)
  - `POST /api/v2/game/start` — creates KV session, queries D1 character pool (500 chars, ≥5 attributes)
  - `POST /api/v2/game/answer` — processes answer, returns next question or guess
  - `POST /api/v2/game/result` — records win/loss stats in `game_stats` table
  - `useServerGame` hook for client integration
- **Phase 5: Character images via R2** — download → sharp → WebP → R2 (S3 API)
- AI attribute enrichment pipeline (`scripts/ingest/enrich.ts`)
- Character ingestion pipeline (`scripts/ingest/`) — AniList, WikiData, TMDB, IGDB, ComicVine adapters
- Expanded attribute taxonomy (150+ attributes) with generation script
- Seed SQL generation from `DEFAULT_CHARACTERS` and `DEFAULT_QUESTIONS`
- D1 migrations: `game_stats` table, `DEFAULT_CHARACTERS` attributes seed, image URLs
- Security headers and caching rules for static assets
- Pre-commit hook (Husky)
- Playwright and Context7 MCP configurations
- Performance optimizations: lazy loading, improved caching, new API endpoints
